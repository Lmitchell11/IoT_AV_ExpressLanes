This project was made by Liam Mitchell while studying the Internet of Things at CMU University. We were challenged to come up with
real world concept ideas and apply them. With a hot modern topic of being at the cusp of having fully Autonomous Vehicles on the road
we were further challanged to come up with a complex idea that could integrate the two together. With that, came the idea (no not the first
person to think of this) but to integrate sensor circuits up with our road infrastructure so it too can gather helpful data in a world
full of people obsessed with technology.

Big Thanks to Professor Yelamarthi for supplying our class with brand new parts, and allowing us to have a great learning oppurtunity
